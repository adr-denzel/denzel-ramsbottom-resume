        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            With an educational and early-career background in civil engineering I've been exposed
            to the great impact infrastructure and universal services play in the elevation of peoples'
            needs, quality of life, and prospects. And even though I've moved on from practicing civil
            engineering, engineering skills, design principles, and ethical practice were the skills
            I took with me.
            <br>
            <br>
            I seen in software, the internet, and mass-market microprocessor technologies the ability to
            leverage imagination and problem-solving with fewer of the restrictions imposed by the physical world.
            And with those additional degrees of freedom I've dedicated myself to crafting software, digital services,
            infrastructure and technologies to provide accessible solutions to both conventional and as-yet unthought
            of challenges to good quality lives and living.
